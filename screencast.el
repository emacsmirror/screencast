;;; Commentary:

;; This file allows you to create video-like sessions, which
;; demonstrates the capabilities of Emacs.

;;; Usage:

;; Install this file to an appropriate directory in your load-path,
;; and add these expressions to your ~/.emacs

;; (auto-load 'screencast "screencast")

;; Try it out by evaluating (screencast-screencast-producer) and (screencast-screencast-user)

;; Your own screencast files should have a (require 'screencast)

;;; Conventions:

;; PRODUCER : creates a screencast

;; USER     : sees a screencast

;; producer sections in this document contains variables which the producer
;; should modify as need be, and functions to be called during the creation of a
;; screencast

;;; Change-log:

;; 1.0: core functionality

;; 1.1: PRODUCER ADDITIONS:
;;      public variables which contain information about the current screencast
;;      ability to change last-command and last-command-char
;;      ability to use let and flet, while still outputting command descriptions
;;      ability to create blinking sections to move the attention towards those
;;	ability to show the region as if transient-mark-mode was on
;;
;;      split the screencasts for the producer into a basic and an advanced
;;	voice synthesizing of typed text. Requires festival to be installed.
;;	global speed control
;;      typed strings in screencasts can not contain tabs and newlines
